## [1.3.0] - 2025-06-30

### Added

-   **Process Individual Files**: The CLI now accepts both directory and individual file paths, allowing for more granular control over which files are processed.
-   **Expanded Keywords**: Added a comprehensive list of keywords to `pyproject.toml` to significantly improve package discoverability on PyPI and search engines.
-   **Beta Features Flag**: Introduced a `--beta` command-line flag to enable experimental features that are under development.

### Changed

-   **Header Text Update**: Changed the auto-generated header to "Table of content is automatically generated by Agent Docstrings {version}".
-   **Streamlined Header Format**: The format of the generated "Table of Contents" has been improved. Top-level functions and classes are now presented in a single, chronologically sorted list, removing the nested "Functions" section for a cleaner, more intuitive layout.
-   **Deterministic Sorting**: All discovered items (classes, methods, functions) are now strictly sorted by their line number in the source file, ensuring a consistent and predictable output every time.
-   **CLI Argument Renaming**: The `DIRECTORY` argument in the CLI has been renamed to `PATH` to accurately reflect its new capability to handle both files and directories.
-   **Header Version Updates**: The tool will now update the header if the generator version has changed, even if the code structure remains the same, ensuring docstrings always reflect the version of the tool that generated them.
-   **Repository URLs**: Updated project URLs in `pyproject.toml` to point to the correct `AgentDocstrings` repository name.

### Fixed

-   **Error Handling for Inaccessible Directories**: Fixed a crash (`PermissionError`) that occurred when scanning directories with restricted read permissions. The application will now skip such directories and print a warning, preventing unintended modifications to files that might have been excluded by an unreadable `.gitignore` or other configuration files.
-   **Deleting empty lines**: Detected and fixed the removal of empty lines at the end of processed files
-   **Language-Specific Indentation**: Fixed the indentation in the generated 'Table of Contents' to respect common style conventions for each language (e.g., 4 spaces for Python, 2 for JavaScript).

### Documentation

-   **Complete README Overhaul**: The `README.md` has been completely rewritten to be more comprehensive, professional, and user-friendly. It now includes a clear project mission, a detailed table of contents, expanded sections on features and usage, new examples, and platform compatibility information.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-06-30

### Added

-   **Python Docstring Merging**: Implemented a feature to merge the auto-generated header with existing manual module-level docstrings in Python files, preserving user-written content.

### Changed

-   **Test Suite Refactoring**: Significantly refactored the test suite by introducing a `source_processor` fixture. This simplifies test code, removes boilerplate for file creation, and improves readability across all test files.

### Documentation

-   Updated the repository URL in `README.md`.
-   Reorganized `README.md` for better readability by moving the "Supported Languages" section to the top.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-29

### Added

-   **Generator Versioning**: The tool's version is now embedded in the generated docstring for easier tracking and debugging.
-   **Header Preservation**: Implemented intelligent detection to preserve file headers (e.g., shebangs, encoding declarations, Go package definitions, leading comments/imports) across all supported languages.
-   **Expanded Language Support**: Added initial processing support and type mappings for Java, PowerShell, Delphi, and C.
-   **Enhanced Testing**: Introduced new test suites for determinism, header preservation, and line number accuracy to ensure core feature reliability.
-   **Initial release of `agent-docstrings`**

### Changed

-   **Python Parser Overhaul**: Replaced the fragile regex-based Python parser with a robust implementation using Python's native Abstract Syntax Tree (`ast`) module. This provides highly accurate parsing of complex function signatures, decorators, type hints, and nested class structures.
-   **Line Numbering Accuracy**: Completely reworked the line number calculation to account for preserved file headers and the size of the injected docstring, ensuring the table of contents is always accurate.

### Fixed

-   **`__future__` Import Placement**: Corrected a critical bug where `from __future__ import` statements were incorrectly moved below the generated docstring, breaking Python file syntax.
-   **Docstring Management**: Hardened the logic for identifying and removing agent-generated docstrings by using more specific start/end markers, preventing accidental modification of user-written docstrings.
-   **Generic Parser**: Improved the generic parser for C-style languages, resolving a known bug that affected brace counting and failed C# file parsing.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-29

### AST-parsing

-   **Go Language**:
    -   Implemented a new, high-precision AST parser using Go's native `go/parser` and `go/ast` libraries. This significantly improves the accuracy of identifying functions, methods, and types in `.go` files compared to previous methods.
    -   Added a `build_goparser.ps1` script to automate the compilation of the Go parser into an executable.
    -   Integrated the new parser into the main Python application, replacing the old logic for Go file analysis.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-27

### Fixed

-   **Parser improvements**:
    -   Correctly identifies functions with `async def`.
    -   Better handling of functions with decorators.
-   **Docstring placement**:
    -   Ensures auto-generated docstrings are placed after shebang (`#!`) and encoding (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`) lines.
-   **Unified docstring handling**:
    -   Intelligently integrates auto-generated docstrings into existing manual docstrings.
    -   Replaces content of existing auto-generated docstrings while preserving manual additions.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-27

### Added

-   **Multi-language support**: Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, PowerShell, Delphi, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript

-   **Python version compatibility**: Full support for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
-   **Type annotations**: Complete type hint support using `typing` module for backward compatibility
-   **CLI interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tool with verbose output option
